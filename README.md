CI_Project
==========

This is the code for a CodeIgniter Project I have done. The purpose of it was mainly to learn the CodeIgniter PHP Framework and explore its features. The project is the start of a prototype for a webshop selling machine parts. I have just concentrated on functionality - so, no focus on design.

The folder contains also the related SQL database.

In order to set it up, I have been working with the localhost on Wamp Server.

Therefore, the application is configured to work with the following details:

hostname: localhost database: dp username: danypot password: b9M83nvcSqG8MaV9

For Apache, please activate rewrite_module because I am using rewrite mode to get rid of the index.php from my application's URL.

For testing: Access the application with: localhost/dp/

Within the website, you can log in as an administrator, using: Email: admin@dp.com Password: admin

Or log in as regular registered users:

User 1: Email: peter.p@gmail.com Password: 12345

User 2: Email: rox.pop@gmail.com Password: emilus
